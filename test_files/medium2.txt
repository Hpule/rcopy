Medium2 Test File

This is a medium-sized text file designed to test the file copy program.
It contains multiple lines of text to simulate a realistic file.
Each line is distinct and the overall file size spans several hundred bytes.

The purpose of this file is to ensure that the file is segmented into multiple packets.
Even though the file is not very large, it may require more than one network packet
depending on the buffer size you specify.
